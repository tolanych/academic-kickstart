I was born on 19 August, 1993 in Borisov, Republic of Belarus.

The field of my interests is in area of a WebDev and GameDev.

I'm a creative person I guess, and humor helps me to overcome life difficulties. Still, I have the ability to abstract from harsh reality and to look for an optimal complete solution. In the childhood I gave preference the humanities (history, geography, art), but as adolecent my keen interest pulled me to techology.
