I was born at 19 August 1993 in Republic Belarus, Borisov.

I feel my interests lie primarily in web development and GameDev.

I'm a creative person and use humor to overcome the difficulties, and I also can easily abstract from the world to look at any problem in order to find a more complex and harmonic solution. I was more interested in the Humanities (i.e. history, geographics, art) in my childhood, but since 2007 I've begun taking an interest in technical direction.
